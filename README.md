### Data Cleaning and Preparations
The data cleaning and preparation phase involves transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. This process includes handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and creating new features that can aid in analysis.

### Steps for Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Data Loading and Inspection
- Handling Missing Values:
### Exploratory Data Analysis

  1.  Identify columns with missing values and assess their impact on analysis.
  2.  Data correction:

    -   Check each column’s data type to ensure it aligns with its expected format (e.g., Date columns as DateTime, Sales as Decimal or Integer).
    -   Parse date fields if they’re formatted inconsistently, ensuring they follow a standard date format.
    -   Removing Duplicates

- Total Sales: Create a calculated field for total sales, such as Total Sales = Quantity * Unit Price.
- Subscription Duration: Calculate the length of each customer’s subscription based on Start Date and End Date.
